# Voting Assistance Chatbot

This repository contains the code for a Voting Assistance Chatbot designed to simplify access to voting-related information. Built with **LangChain** and **Chainlit**, the chatbot uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to assist users with queries about voter registration, eligibility, polling stations, and other voting processes.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can interact in plain language to receive answers to voting-related questions.
- **Knowledge Retrieval**: Uses a `VectorStoreRetriever` to provide precise and relevant responses.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Ensures fast and efficient handling of user queries without blocking operations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with **Chainlit** for a seamless and interactive user experience.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extensible to include more features, such as multilingual support or additional knowledge sources.

## Technology Stack

- **Python**: Backend logic and chatbot implementation.
- **LangChain**: For creating conversational AI workflows and retrieval-based question answering.
- **Chainlit**: For building the user interface and chatbot interaction framework.
- **VectorStore**: Stores and retrieves knowledge base documents for accurate answers.
